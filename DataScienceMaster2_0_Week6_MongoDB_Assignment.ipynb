        "# * Rich Query Language: MongoDB supports a powerful and expressive query language that allows developers to perform complex queries, including filtering, sorting, aggregation,\n",

        "# * Cross-Platform Support: MongoDB is cross-platform and runs on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and popular Linux distributions.\n",
